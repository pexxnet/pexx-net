                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about your interactions with our website, including IP
                        addresses, browser type, pages visited, time spent, and device type, to improve your experience

                </ul>

                <h2>2. Why We Collect Information</h2>
                <p>We collect data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Provide Services:</strong> Your personal and service data is required to activate new
                        services, process orders, plan upgrades, and execute account changes such as cancellations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We use your contact and service data to provide technical
                        support
                        and resolve any issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Billing and Payments:</strong> Your financial data is used to process payments for
                        services,
                        including our execution charges, which are clearly disclosed on our website and range from
                        $49.99 to
                        $199.99.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvement and Marketing:</strong> With your consent, we use non-identifying data to
                        improve our services, assess site traffic, and offer promotions aligned with your preferences.
                        We
                        ensure that any data collected is transparent, and we fully comply with Googleâ€™s guidelines by
                        not
                        misrepresenting any element of our services or the fees associated with them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
                <p>ImpexxNet partners with third-party vendors, including payment processors and JNA-certified service
                    providers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, Spectrum, Xfinity, Dish, and others. While we ensure they
                    adhere to
                    strict privacy standards, we encourage you to review their privacy policies for more details about
                    their
                    data handling practices.</p>

                <h2>4. Transparency in Pricing and Billing</h2>
                <p>ImpexxNet prides itself on full transparency regarding pricing and charges. In compliance with Googleâ€™s
                    Ads
                    Policy, we clearly state all charges for services upfront:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Execution Fees:</strong> Charges for services like new connections, plan changes, or
                        cancellations range from $49.99 to $199.99 and are prominently displayed before you commit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate Billing:</strong> Execution fees charged by ImpexxNet are separate from charges
                        by
                        your service provider (such as Verizon, Xfinity or Spectrum), which will be outlined in your
                        agreement with the provider.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Fees:</strong> All recurring charges are clearly explained in advance to
                        avoid
                        any confusion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not engage in any misleading or dishonest pricing practices, ensuring that all costs are
                    transparent to the user before they make a commitment.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We take rigorous measures to secure your personal information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All sensitive data, such as financial and personal information, is
                        encrypted during transmission and storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Only authorized employees with specific roles have access to
                        your
                        data, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Payment Gateways:</strong> We use industry-standard, third-party payment
                        processors
                        to handle transactions securely.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If there is ever a data breach, ImpexxNet will notify you and relevant authorities as per legal
                    obligations.</p>
