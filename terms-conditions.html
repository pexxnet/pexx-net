                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <p>Welcome to ImpexxNet. These Terms &amp; Conditions govern your use of our website, services, and
                    products. By accessing or using our services, you agree to these terms, which establish a legally
                    binding agreement between you and ImpexxNet. Please read these carefully to understand your rights and
                    obligations.</p>

                <h3>1. Services Offered</h3>
                <p>ImpexxNet is an authorized dealer and certified retailer offering services such as internet, streaming,
                    and cellular packages through third-party service providers. Our role is to facilitate customer
                    access to these services and provide related execution services including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New connections</li>
                    <li>Bill payments</li>
                    <li>Plan upgrades</li>
                    <li>Account cancellations</li>
                    <li>Technician visits</li>
                    <li>Service installation</li>
                    <li>Service relocation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While we ensure smooth service execution, please note that we are an independent entity and do not
                    control the services offered by third-party providers.</p>

                <h3>2. Execution Service Charges</h3>
                <p>ImpexxNet charges fees for execution services ranging from $49.99 to $199.99, depending on the specific
                    request. These fees are separate from any charges imposed by your service provider. Once a service
                    is executed, these fees are non-refundable as outlined in our Refund Policy.</p>

                <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Our services may include partnerships with third-party providers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, Xfinity,
                    Dish, and Spectrum. ImpexxNet does not own, operate, or manage these third-party services. You
                    acknowledge that service performance, delivery, and terms are governed by the respective service
                    provider's agreements. ImpexxNet acts solely as a mediator and cannot guarantee the quality or
                    availability of the services provided by these external entities.</p>

                <h3>4. User Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>By using our services, you agree to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate and up-to-date personal and financial information.</li>
                    <li>Adhere to any applicable third-party providerâ€™s terms and conditions.</li>
                    <li>Be responsible for payment of all applicable charges and fees.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that any actions you take on our platform are legal and in good faith.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Payment Terms</h3>
                <p>Payments for ImpexxNetâ€™s execution services are due at the time of the service request. Charges related
                    to third-party services (such as monthly bills from your internet or cellular provider) are handled
                    directly through the provider, and ImpexxNet bears no responsibility for third-party billing issues.
                    You may contact us if you need assistance in understanding your bill or seeking refunds from service
                    providers, but such refunds will be governed by the third-party provider's policy.</p>

                <h3>6. No Misrepresentation</h3>
                <p>In compliance with Googleâ€™s Ads Policy, ImpexxNet ensures all service details, pricing, and
                    affiliations are transparent and not misleading. We do not claim affiliations or endorsements from
                    any third-party providers unless explicitly authorized. Customers are encouraged to verify the
                    nature of our services through direct communication with ImpexxNet representatives.</p>

                <h3>7. Termination of Services</h3>
                <p>ImpexxNet reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to our services in the event of
                    non-payment, abuse of services, or breach of these terms. Termination of services with any
                    third-party provider must be handled through the provider directly, and ImpexxNet will offer
                    assistance where needed.</p>

                <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>ImpexxNet will not be held liable for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any disruption, delay, or error in the services provided by third-party providers.</li>
                    <li>Misuse of your personal or financial information by unauthorized third parties.</li>
                    <li>Any damages, whether direct or indirect, arising from your use of our services or the services
                        of third-party providers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9. Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>Your use of our services is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which outlines how we collect, use,
                    and protect your personal information. Please review this policy to understand our data-handling
                    practices.</p>

                <h3>10. Changes to Terms</h3>
                <p>ImpexxNet may update or change these terms from time to time to reflect new business practices,
                    regulatory changes, or industry standards. When changes occur, we will notify users via email or
                    through notices on our website. Continued use of our services after the update constitutes
                    acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

                <h3>11. Governing Law</h3>

                    Any legal disputes related to these terms or our services must be filed in the appropriate courts
